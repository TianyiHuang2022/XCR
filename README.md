# XCR
Python implementation of XCR. Run "clustering.py" for clustering and then run "PCAMapping.py" for visualization. If you use our code or data, please cite "X-Clustering Beyond Contextual Representations".


The method is tested on MNIST-Fashion. Networks are trained by PyTorch 2.0 and Python 3.9.
Visualization is based on pandas 1.5.3 and matplotlib 3.7.1.
